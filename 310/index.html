				SLIDE INSTRUCTIONS:
					- Set the <title> tag to this lesson's US English title
					- Set the <meta description tag to the US English course & lesson title
					- Add one <section></div></section> for each slide. Slides can contain most any valid HTML
					- Each text tag (<p> or <li> or <h1> etc.) must have a class name that begins with
						"l_" and is unique. Each of those class names must be added to the i18n/localizations.js
						file and their values must be set equal to the US English version of the strings. That 
						file is used for translation and its contents OVERRIDES the text in this file.
					- Each slide must have a <div class="slidenote"></div> container, which can be empty. These
						are used for presenter notes. They also must be given unique "l_" classnames and strings
						provided in the localizations.js file.
					- Please use inline CSS on the slides to size & arrange contents.
					- Graphics should be placed in the images folder and cropped/sized appropriately.
					- Assume a 1024 x 768 display resolution
					- A link to the index.html for each lesson must be added in order to the coursename/index.html
						title slide.

This is important for everyone that touches the project to be aware of so that it drives the right experience for the user. <br> - Focus on your primary consumer. Which one makes you the money? If there are more than 5 segments to your market, pick the top two. You will not be able to please everyone with your app. That is why there is more than 90,000 of them in the app store. This is why we see massive updates to how apps work. <br> - <b>Example: </b> A good example of this is the Facebook app. If you have Facebook apps or pages, you can't use their app to control them. This is by design, as 600 million people want to read their news feed, and only a fraction of a percentile of those people will manage their pages. <br> - Remove your personal opinion. If you are working on the project you are probably to close to the product. Always revert back to the consumer and ask “Is it what they need”. <br> - <b>Recommendation: </b> Put a picture of your key consumer on your desk when working on the project to remind you who this is for.</div>
